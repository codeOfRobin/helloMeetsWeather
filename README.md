# HelloMeets iOS meetups

### Who is this for?

This meetup is intended for beginner programmers who want to get acquainted with iOS Development. Beginner programming knowledge, however, is necessary. We'll be covering basic concepts such as Auto Layout, Size Classes, sending requests to APIs etc to build a basic weather app.

Note : If all of this sounds foreign to you, don't sweat it. Just brush up on control structures, iteration, recursion and file handling in the language of your choice.

### What will we be building?

We'll be building a weather app called X&O Weather. It consists of a 3X3 grid that shows the 9 most important things about the weather right now. It'll use the forecast.io API for information (we'll initially use a .plist file to display the weather initially, though).

### What do I need?

A Mac with the latest version of XCode installed.
Download from the App Store here : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

### Can I look at the app?

Sure, here's a screenshot
